          Dido Elizabeth Belle (June 1761 – July 1804) was a free black British gentlewoman. She was born into slavery
          and illegitimate; her mother, Maria Belle, was an enslaved Black woman in the British West Indies. Her father
          was Sir John Lindsay, a British career naval officer who was stationed there. Her father was knighted and promoted
          to admiral. Lindsay took Belle with him when he returned to England in 1765, entrusting her upbringing to his
          uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, and his wife Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Mansfield.
          The Murrays educated Belle, bringing her up as a free gentlewoman at their Kenwood House, together with another
          great-niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray, whose mother had died. Lady Elizabeth and Belle were second cousins. Belle
          lived there for 30 years. In his will of 1793, Lord Mansfield provided an outright sum and an annuity to her.

          Dido Elizabeth Belle was born into slavery in 1761 in the British West Indies to an enslaved African woman
          known as Maria Belle. (Her name was spelled as Maria Bell in her daughter's baptism record.) Her father was
          24-year-old Sir John Lindsay, a member of the Lindsay family of Evelix branch of the Clan Lindsay and a descendant
          of the Clan Murray, who was a career naval officer and then captain of the British warship HMS Trent, based in the
          West Indies. He was the son of Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet and his wife Amelia, daughter of David Murray,
          5th Viscount Stormont. Lindsay is thought to have found Maria Belle held as a slave on a Spanish ship which his
          forces captured in the Caribbean. Lindsay returned to London after the war in 1765 with his young daughter,
          Dido Belle. When they arrived in England he took her to Kenwood House just outside the city, the home of his uncle,
          William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, and his wife Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Mansfield. Belle was baptised as
          Dido Elizabeth Belle in 1766 at St George's, Bloomsbury. The Murray family raised Belle as an educated woman along
          with their niece and Dido's cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray, whose mother had died.

          A contemporary obituary of Sir John Lindsay, who had eventually been promoted to admiral, acknowledged that he was
          the father of Dido Belle, and described her: "[H]e has died, we believe, without any legitimate issue but has left
          one natural daughter, a Mulatta who has been brought up in Lord Mansfield's family almost from her infancy and whose
          amiable disposition and accomplishments have gained her the highest respect from all his Lordship's relations and
          visitants. [1] At one time, historians thought her mother was an African slave on a ship captured by Lindsay's warship
          during the Siege of Havana,[5] but this specific date is unlikely, as Dido was born in 1761.

          Belle died in 1804[33] at the age of 43, and was interred in July of that year at St George's Fields,
          Westminster, a burial ground close to what is now Bayswater Road..
          Rest in peace, Dido Belle.
